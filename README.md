# Accident Detection and Emergency Alert System

##Project Overview
This project implements an Accident Detection and Emergency Alert System using IoT technology.  
The system detects accidents automatically using a vibration sensor and immediately sends an emergency alert through radio communication, without relying on mobile networks.  
It is designed to provide fast and reliable emergency response in remote or network-poor areas.

##Technologies & Components Used
- Microcontroller (Arduino / ESP module)
- Vibration Sensor
- RF Transmitter & Receiver (Radio Communication)
- Buzzer
- Power Supply
- Embedded C / Arduino IDE

##Working Principle
1. The vibration sensor continuously monitors vehicle impact levels.
2. When vibration exceeds a predefined threshold, the system identifies it as an accident.
3. An emergency alert signal is transmitted using RF communication.
4. The receiver unit triggers an alarm and displays emergency status.
5. Immediate response can be initiated without mobile or internet dependency.

##Key Advantages
- Works without GSM or mobile network
